## Quiz 1: Java Basics

### Due: 06/26/2025, midnight

### Todo

1. For this repo.
2. Clone your forked repo to your IDE.
4. Finish the [3 exercises](https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/2025-Summer-143-hello-world/tree/main/src/Exercise). No need to create a new branch. Main is fine to work in.
5. Submit your forked repo link once work is done.

### Forking repo? How

Please use GPT and YouTube to figure out how to fork a GitHub repository. You'll be doing this a lot in the quarter so it's worth the time to learn it right.

We will also demonstrate this in Thursday lecture.

### Grading

Each task is worth 10 pts. With sufficient work shown, you'll receive full points. 0 pt otherwise. In quiz we usually don't do partial credits. It's up to the teacher/grader to define what "sufficient" means. If you are not sure, please ask them before due date.
