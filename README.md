## Quiz 1: Java Basics

### Due: 06/26/2025, midnight

---

### ✅ Todo

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone your forked repo into your IDE.
3. Finish the [3 exercises](https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/2025-Summer-143-hello-world/tree/main/src/Exercise).  
   No need to create a new branch — working on `main` is fine.
4. Submit your **forked repo link** once you're done.

### 💡 Forking a repo? Use GPT or YouTube.

You'll do this a lot this quarter, so it's worth learning it now.  
We will demo it in Thursday’s lecture too.

**Prompt suggestions for GPT:**

- “How do I fork a GitHub repository and clone it to my computer?”
- “How do I commit and push changes to a forked GitHub repo?”
- “How do I check if I pushed my code to the correct GitHub repo?”
- “How do I navigate Java files in IntelliJ or VS Code?”

If stuck, try asking specific follow-ups like:
> "I forked the repo but don't see the changes I made. What could be wrong?"  
> "I'm new to IntelliJ — how do I open and run a Java file?"

### 🧪 Grading

Each task is worth **10 pts**.  
With **sufficient work shown**, you’ll receive full points. **0 pt otherwise.**

Note: In quizzes, partial credit is usually not given. It’s the grader’s discretion to decide what counts as “sufficient.” If unsure, ask before the due date.
